## Project Log
### Preliminary findings
#### Data
- [Lawsuits](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/query-manager/query/3871927/) definition in WRDs: this pertains to actions or suits brought before a court against the company, as to recover a right or redress a grievance.
- WRDs is able to produce a [graphic summary](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/query-manager/query-document/901368/) of the event you are interested in. In particular, it plots CAR within the event window, together with CI. It also generates breakdown of everyday CAR table as well as event date list. Now I am trying to download them.
- To refer to Adrian's notes, we can compute J_1 to test if the average CAR is significant.
